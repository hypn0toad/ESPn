This project consists of a multi platform communication device that was intended to be used as a gift. 

arduino_main = the main arduino code for the devices
arduino_slave = test code to be used in a prototype system. allows a serial interface on the PC (uart) to communicate through the arduino back and forth from an imp
imp = the imp code, needs to be loaded int he planner to both imps

docs = random datasheets
