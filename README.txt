This project consists of a multi platform communication device that was intended to be used as a gift / could be considered an art project. 

arduino_main/    = the main arduino code for the devices
arduino_slave/   = test code to be used in a prototype system. allows a serial interface on the PC (uart) to communicate through the arduino back and forth from an imp
imp/            = the imp code, needs to be loaded in the planner to both imps
docs/           = partslist/BOM, pinout reference, issue tracking (future ideas & bugs)
docs/datasheets = random datasheets for parts used in the design
docs/schematics = schematic and PWB for main board; schematic for logic level slave board
